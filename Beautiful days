Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse. For instance, given the number 12, its reverse is 21.Their difference is 9.The number 120 reversed is 21,and their difference is 99.
Given a range of numbered days,[i,---j] and a number k,determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful.Beautiful numbers are defined as numbers where |i-reverse(i)| is evenly divisible by k. If a day's value is a beautiful number,it is a beautiful day. Return the number of beautiful days in the range.
