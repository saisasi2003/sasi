The Binary number system only uses two digits, 0 and 1 and number system can be called binary string.

The function accepts a string str as its argument. The string str consists of binary digits eparated with an alphabet as follows:

– A denotes AND operation
– B denotes OR operation
– C denotes XOR Operation
You are required to calculate the result of the string str, scanning the string to right taking one opearation at a time, and return the same.
Input:
str: 1C0C1C1A0B1

Output:
1

Explanation:
The alphabets in str when expanded becomes “1 XOR 0 XOR 1 XOR 1 AND 0 OR 1”, result of the expression becomes 1, hence 1 is returned.

Sample Input:
0C1A1B1C1C1B0A0

Output:
0
======
s=input()
r=int(s[0])
for i in range(1,len(s)-1):
    if s[i]=='a':
        r&=int(s[i+1])
    elif s[i]=='b':
        r|=int(s[i+1])
    elif s[i]=='c':
        r^=int(s[i+1])
    i=i+2
print(r)
