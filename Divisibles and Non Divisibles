The function accepts two integers n, m as arguments Find the sum of all numbers in range from 1 to m(both inclusive) that are not divisible by n. Return difference between sum of integers not divisible by n with sum of numbers divisible by n.

Input
n:4
m:20
Output
90

Explanation

Sum of numbers divisible by 4 are 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 = 60
Sum of numbers not divisible by 4 are 1 +2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 150
Difference 150 â€“ 60 = 90
====
n=int(input())
m=int(input())
s1=s2=0
for i in range(1,m+1):
    if i%n==0:
        s1+=i
    else:
        s2+=i
print(s2-s1)
