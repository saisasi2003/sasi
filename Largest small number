The function accepts an integers arr of size ’length’ as its arguments you are required to return the sum of second largest  element from the even positions and second smallest from the odd position of given ‘arr’
Example

Input

arr:3 2 1 7 5 4

Output

7

Explanation

Second largest among even position elements(1 3 5) is 3
Second smallest among odd position element is 4
Thus output is 3+4 = 7
====
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
a.sort()
print(a[1]+a[-2])
