The function accepts a string  ‘ str’ of length n and two characters ‘ch1’ and ‘ch2’ as its arguments . Implement the function to modify and return the string ‘ str’ in such a way that all occurrences of ‘ch1’ in original string are replaced by ‘ch2’ and all occurrences of ‘ch2’  in original string are replaced by ‘ch1’.

Assumption: String Contains only lower-case alphabetical letters.

Note:

Return null if string is null.
If both characters are not present in string or both of them are same , then return the string unchanged.
Example:

Input:
Str: apples
ch1:a
ch2:p
Output:
paales
======
s=input()
c1,c2=map(str,input().split())
l=[]
for i in s:
    if i==c1:
        l.append(c2)
    elif i==c2:
        l.append(c1)
    else:
        l.append(i)
for i in l:
    print(i,end="")
