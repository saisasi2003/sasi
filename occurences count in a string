There is a string, s. of lowercase English letters that is repeated infinitely many times. Given an integer, n, find and print the number of letter a's in the first n letters of the infinite string.

Example
s = 'abcac'
n = 10

The substring we consider is abcacabcac, the first 10 characters of the infinite string. There are 4 occurrences of a in the substring.
Problem

Input
aba 
10
Output 
7
Explanation
